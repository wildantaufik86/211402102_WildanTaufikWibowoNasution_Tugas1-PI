### Task 1

```bash
  Write a program using Python that reads in the user's salary and divides the number by
  12 months. The monthly salary should be output to the console with 0 decimal places
  rounded up. For example, if the user enters 60000 the program should display 5000. 
  The file should be named task1.py.
```
### Task 2

```bash
  Write a program that reads in a whole number and divides it by 3 and displays the result
  with three decimal places if they exist (rounded up). For example, if the user enters 2
  the program should display 0.667. For example, if the user enters 9999 the program
  should display 3,333.0. The file should be named task2.py.
```
### Task 3

```bash
  Write a program that reads in a number and prints either Small, Medium or Large
  depending on if the number is below 100 or above 200. For example, if the user enters
  150 the program should display “Medium”. Another example is if the user enters 50 the
  program should display “Small”. The file should be named task3.py.
```
### Task 4

```bash
  Write a program that reads in a number and prints the sum of all values from 1 up to the
  number. For example, if the user enters 5 the program should display 15. 
  15 is (1+2+3+4+5). The file should be named task4.py.
```
### Task 5

```bash
  Write a program that reads in numbers until a -1 is entered and prints the sum of all
  numbers entered. For example, if the user enters 5 10 15 -1 the program should display
  30 (Each number will be separated by a carriage return). 30 is (5+10+15). The file
  should be named task5.py.
```
